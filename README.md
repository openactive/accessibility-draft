description: Addressing accessibility needs in OpenActive
---

# Introduction

Accessibility is a central concern for OpenActive: our mission is to use open data to get more people more active. In a world where [more than 80%](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/how-to-beat/on-demand/70184-001) of disabled people feel that gyms are unwelcoming, that means doing everything we can to give them more information about the support that's available to them - including driving improvements to industry best practice in data-gathering and publication.

However, improving the quantity and quality of data related to accessibility presents several challenges, including

* lack of consistency in how data is gathered
* lack of consistency in how data is communicated
* varying and evolving understandings of 'disability' and 'accessibility' 
* differences in the extent to which individuals identify as 'disabled'
* blurry lines between accessibility and other health-related needs
* the highly-bespoke nature of much accessibility information

The challenge, then, is to create a data model that is sufficiently well-defined to capture adequate accessibility information and encourage good practice, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate the evolving understandings and wide range of needs confronting individuals with enhanced accessibility requirements.
