# contactPoint

Accessibility needs are complex and individual: very often, disabled individuals will want to get in touch with someone who can provide them with fine-grained information about the kind of support offered and how suitable it is for their needs. As such, `contactPoint` information is highly valued by those with accessibility needs, particularly in regard to activities they have never tried before.
