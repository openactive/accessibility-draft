description: Providing basic information about accessibility
---

# Overview

Many organisations will have only very basic accessibility information to convey. This may be because their provision for accessibility is low, because their data-collection practices are  limited, or maybe just because both provision and data-collection are straightforward. Whatever the reason, however, it is important to communicate whatever information is available in a clear and consistent way. 

The attributes listed under the 'Top-Level Attributes' heading are designed to allow just that: a straightforward means of communicating the most important information about an activity or, more frequently, a place, such as a gym, community hall, or leisure centre.
