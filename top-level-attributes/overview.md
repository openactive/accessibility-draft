description: Providing basic information about accessibility
---

# Overview

Many organisations will have only very basic accessibility information to convey. This may be because their provision for accessibility is low, because their data-collection practices are  limited, or maybe just because both provision and data-collection are straightforward. Whatever the reason, however, it is important to communicate whatever information is available in a clear and consistent way. 

The attributes listed under the 'Top-Level Attributes' heading are designed to allow just that: a basic means of communicating the most important information about an activity or, more frequently, a place, such as a gym, community hall, or leisure centre.

The names of the top-level attributes are in most cases self-explanatory:

* [accessibilitySupportLevel](accessibilitysupportlevel.md) indicates the degree of support offered to participants with accessibility needs
* [amenityFeature](amenityfeature.md) is any piece of physical infrastructure designed to assist individuals with accessibility needs, such as e.g. disabled toilets or changing stalls.
* [carerPolicy](carerpolicy.md) describes any conditions of attendance or perquisites available for carers attending a facility or activity with a participant.
* [contactPoint](contactpoint.md) gives information about who to contact regarding accessibility needs
* [transportNote](transportnote.md) captures information about getting to and from a facility or event

For more complex needs, see the section on [`accessibilitySupport` Attributes](../accessibility-support/overview.md).
