# review

Data and assessment assurance can be difficult in relation to accessibility needs, and trust in claims of being 'accessible' or 'disability friendly' is often low. Publishing user reviews are one way of gathering feedback and gaining the trust of disabled users.

Note that `reviews` may be collected either regarding a venue as a whole, or of a particular event within that venue. 

It is advised that systems implementing `review` have some mechanism for moderation of these, rather than automatically publishing these as received.
