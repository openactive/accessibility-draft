Some accessibility needs are best met by having a carer in attendance; often, this will be a prerequisite for participation in a physical activity. Many organisations, then, offer discounts or free passes to individuals attending in the capacity of carer. 

This property is a free text field, meaning that any information in whatever form relating to carers can be entered here. It may be attached either to a place or to an opportunity.
