# transportNote

Transport can present unusual challenges for individuals with accessibility needs. Not only are disabled people more likely than average to be reliant on public transport, they may be constrained to particular paths because of requiring e.g. step-free access or audio signals to approach a venue safely. Providing detailed information about transport can increase user confidence and thus the eventual likelihood of actual attendance at an event.

Note that the presence of disabled parking should normally be communicated as an [`amenityFeature`](amenityfeature.md).
