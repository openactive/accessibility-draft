# A Note on Linking

In many cases, organisations will have a single webpage or section on their site dealing with accessibility needs. In cases where this information is all that is available, and/or listing out all accessibility information in each data item would be too cumbersome, a simple link to the relevant part of the website may be provided. This should be done using the `accessibilitySupport.url` attribute. 

For more information and an example of how this is done, see the [`url` Links in Place of Data](../../accessibility-support/url.md#links-in-place-of-data) section.
