# amenityFeature

This property represents the simplest kind of accessibility information, and in many cases may form the most important \(or only\)  accessibility information an organisation has immediately available to it. `amenityFeature` simply asserts the presence of some piece of physical infrastructure \(e.g., disabled parking, wheelchair access\) present at a location and able to assist people with accessibility needs. 

The correct usage of `amenityFeature` is described in the [relevant section](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/EditorsDraft/#describing-amenities) of the Opportunity specification. Note that it applies only to places, rather than to events.

For further information on the relationship between Active Places accessibility data and OpenActive `amenityFeatures`,  see [Mapping To and From Active Places](../tech-notes/mapping-to-active-places.md).
