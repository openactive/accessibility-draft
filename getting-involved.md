# Getting Involved

OpenActive welcomes contributions from the community - particularly with regard to accessibility. There are a variety of channels available for feeding back on our specification, depending on the nature of the feedback and the level of commitment this entails.

Individuals wishing to comment upon or contribute to the accessibility specification may do so by:

* raising an issue in the relevant [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openactive/accessibility-documentation/issues)
* joining the [W3C OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/)
* emailing OpenActive directly at hello@openactive.io

OpenActive particularly welcomes feedback from individuals with disabilities and organisations dedicated to advocacy in this area.

f you find any of these channels to be inaccessible in any way and have suggestions on how we can improve this, please let us know via [hello@openactive.io](mailto:hello@openactive.io).  We try to be as inclusive as possible, and are always open to improvement.
