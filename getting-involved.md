# Getting Involved

OpenActive welcomes contributions from the community - particularly with regard to accessibility. There are a variety of channels available for feeding back on our specification, depending on the nature of the feedback and the level of commitment this entails.

Individuals wishing to comment upon or contribute to the accessibility specification may do so by:

* technical comments and proposals related to the accessibility standard in general can be raised as issues on the GitHub [accessibility-draft repository](https://github.com/openactive/accessibility-draft/issues)
* if your contribution specifically concerns the Participant Condition Supported Vocabulary, issues and proposals can be raised in the dedicated [participant-condition-supported repository](https://github.com/openactive/participant-condition-supported/issues)
* if you want to take an active role in defining and setting the direction of the standard, you can join the [W3C OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/)
* or you can just email us with any other comments or concerns you might have, at **hello@openactive.io**

OpenActive particularly welcomes feedback from individuals with disabilities and organisations dedicated to advocacy in this area.

f you find any of these channels to be inaccessible in any way and have suggestions on how we can improve this, please let us know via [hello@openactive.io](mailto:hello@openactive.io).  We try to be as inclusive as possible, and are always open to improvement.
