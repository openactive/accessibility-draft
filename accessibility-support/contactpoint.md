# contactPoint

In cases where a particular event or opportunity has a more-specific contactPoint than that attached to a facility as a whole, information about it should be provided in the `accessibilitySupport` object. 

For further information and an example regarding `contactPoint`, see its [description](../top-level-attributes/contactpoint.md) under 'Top-Level Attributes'.
