# participantConditionSupported

In cases where an activity or opportunity is recommended as suitable or therapeutic for a particular accessibility need \(e.g., sensory impairment\) or medical condition \(e.g. pregnancy\), this condition should be indicated using the `participantConditionSupported` property.

The values for this property must be drawn from the Participant Condition Supported [controlled vocabulary](https://disab.herokuapp.com/en/hierarchical_concepts.html). Note, however, that this vocabulary is still evolving and is far from static. If you have terms you wish to see added or suggestions for its improvement, please see our [Getting Involved](../getting-involved.md) page to find out how you can contribute.
