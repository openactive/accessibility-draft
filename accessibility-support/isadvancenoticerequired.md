# isAdvanceNoticeRequired

Some kinds of dedicated equipment or support \(e.g., pool hoists\) may require the presence of staff trained in their use. In such cases, gyms and leisure centres often recommend calling ahead to ensure that these staff members are indeed available during the times required.

If `isAdvanceNoticeRequired` is `true`, data publishers are strongly advised to provide `contactPoint` information, whether at a [specific](contactpoint.md) or [general](../top-level-attributes/contactpoint.md) level.
