# Web Standards

OpenActive's accessibility vocabulary has been developed specifically with reference to physical activities and barriers to participating in these. Strictly speaking, then, web accessibility and web standards are outside its scope.

However, there is no point painstakingly gathering and encoding accessibility information for display on a website if that site is then inaccessible to users with e.g. sensory or motor impairments. 

Data publishers who want to ensure the information they are providing is in fact accessible and usable should therefore adhere to best-practice advice in their website design and markup. Useful starting points for this include:

* the UK government's guide to [Making Your Service Accessible](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction)
* the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)

It should be noted, however, that there is no substitute for testing sites with end-users. Even the best guidelines cannot address every circumstance, and organisations are strongly advised to consult with disabled users in user research, and to conduct regular accessibility audits of their sites.
