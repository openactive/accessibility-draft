# Namespaces

In common with all OpenActive specifications, our approach to accessibility is based as far as possible on schema.org. In some cases, however, we have also found it necessary to add our own types and objects in order to accommodate the range of needs found in the physical activity sector. In addition, the [Participant Condition Supported vocabulary ](../accessibility-support/participantconditionsupported.md)is made up of SKOS Concepts.

Accordingly, three namespaces are relevant to OpenActive accessibility:

* `https://schema.org/`. The prefix notation for this is normally `schema:`
* `https://openactive.io/accessibility/`, prefix notation `oax:` 
* `http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#`, prefix `skos:`
